Both problems are schedule based problems

### Problem 1:  
Step 1: State the problem.  
I forget to drink the right amount of water  
  
**Step 2: ** Concrete example of the problem and problem causality.  
I am unsure how much water I am supposed to drink because I have a total and do not track the amount I have drank  
  
**Step 3:** Describe prior solutions
I have made task but because of the swamp of the other task and events in a day I forget to drink water  
  
**Step 4:** Describe a gap in prior solutions  
It tells me to drink water but I have not been tracking total drank  
If I lose track of my task then I may forget to drink water  
There is not much motivation to drink the water  
Bad UX and UI makes most apps irritating to use  

**Step 5** Pose a question for how do we solve this problem by addressing the gap within some constraints  
How can we design a application that allows users to keep track of their water usage and complete goals while making sure they will actually want to complete it?

### Problem 2:  
**Step 1:** State the problem.  
My scheduling tools have no way to communicate with each other  
  
**Step 2:** Concrete example of the problem and problem causality.  
I have a task manager, I have a calendar, and I dont have a tracker but there is no communication between
  
**Step 3:** Describe prior solutions
Some apps may have some integration with tag systems but it is a bad UX and makes it too irritating to do
  
**Step 4: ** Describe a gap in prior solutions
Prior solutions try to mix them together but it is not enough  
I've tried filters  
I've tried tags  
I've tried events  
  
**Step 5: ** Pose a question for how do we solve this problem by addressing the gap within some constraints  
How can we design an application that seamlesly integrates my tasks, my events and my habits with out any redundancy and filters by key for user preference?
